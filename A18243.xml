         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

alſo thinking with my ſelfe what I might preſent ſome way to expreſſe my love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, in remembrance of thoſe not to be requited favours I have received, not onely from your ſelfe, but from that Right worſhipfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and religious Knight your father; and that vertuous Lady your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which have wholy obliged mee to their houſe. I have thought good for the firſt to undertake the tranſlation of <hi>Marcus Auſonius</hi> his foure bookes of morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts intituted <hi>Cato:</hi> and for the latter I am inforced (for want of better way to ſhew my good meaning) to dedicate to you, this rude and ſlender booke tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Latin hexamiters, into Engliſh meter. Wherein if I have any way mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred you occaſion to miſlike me for dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſame unto you (one whoſe love towards me, I muſt and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to requite, though never able to canſell the obligation of your many and infinite curteſies) I truſt you will bee ſo far from taxing of me, that you will rather hold me excuſed therein. For if a man be bound, by all meanes that he may (as ſure
<pb facs="tcp:25221:3"/>
he is) to gratifie his well deſerving friends: then may not I quiet my ſelfe, and be at ſilence till I have deviſed the requitall of ſome part of your friendſhips, by ſome ſlender gift, ſuch as my fortune, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent chance will permit me to exhibit unto you. And none can I finde (ſweet ſir) that in my minde will be more pleaſing to your gentle nature, for the encouraging of you to the laborious and induſtrious obtaining of the Latin tongue, where into you are even now entering: or more fitter for your worſhips tractible diſpoſition, being of very yong, and tender yeeres, and in whom the very ſparkes of a philomathy is already ſeene, then this new tranſlated Poet, which will ſo fill you with ſweet counſell, wholeſome inſtructions, and abundance of knowledge (unto which we muſt all in ſome ſmall meaſure attaine, before we can ſtep to any other grace or vertue, leading to perfection) as alſo teach you, how to behave and carry your ſelfe, in the whole courſe of your life, aſwell towards your inferious as ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that your company will not onely
<pb facs="tcp:25221:4"/>
be admired of all them, that know you, but likewiſe deſired of all thoſe that ſhall at any time be ſo happy, as to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with you. For the Booke it ſelfe is ſo exquiſit that notwithſtanding, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof was a heathen, and had not the true knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus by faith. Whereby we muſt all bee ſaved, living in a time and place where the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes of ſalvation lay hid in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and darkneſſe, as it did a long time after, being many yeeres before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt: yet I pray God, what ere his faith and beliefe was, that his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe and ſtrictneſſe of life towards God and man, doe not condemne us, who are, or would be thought Chriſtians, living under the reſplendent light, and Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of the Goſpell. And although hee was a heathen (as I ſaid before) yet ſhall my charity bee ſuch towards him, being dead, &amp; in whom was ſuch an actuall habit of a good life, whiles he lived, as all the hiſtories that I have read of him, beſides his owne workes, by his many good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to others, left behind him, doe
<pb facs="tcp:25221:4"/>
witneſſe the ſame; I cannot thinke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it ſinke into my heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that hee died altogether in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and knowledge of the true God. For at the very period and end of his daies, being praiſed of the Romans for his courage at his death, laughed: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the cauſe why he laughed; hee anſwered, ye marvaile at that I laugh, and I laugh at that you marvell: for the perils and travels conſidered wherein wee live, and the ſafety wherein wee die, it is no more needfull to have vertue, and ſtrength to live, then courage to die. And if wee looke but a little backe into his life, wee ſhall not have much cauſe to marvell at his comfortable and patient bearing of the ſtroke of death; for he was a man of ſuch milde, and temperate ſpirit, that he could never bee ſeene to be wroth, or out of patience with any man, but alwaies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled that were angry, that if they deſired to live long, cheerefully, and die comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, to banniſh rage, as an enemy to them both; a worthy ſaying of a heathen, and to be had in eſtemation and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb facs="tcp:25221:5"/>
of every good Chriſtian. But ſhould any bee ſo unwiſe, to thinke his precepts are the leſſe worthy of immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for being a Heathen, I would aver the contrary againſt any ſeditious turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit whatſoever, the beſt of us all being bound to receive the doctrines of many which doe write, tending to our good, though wee be not tied to follow the lives which they leade, if bad. Gold is nere the worſe for being preſented unto us, out of a beggers hand in a lether bagge; or a ſermon ere the worſe which we heare preached, becauſe he that preacheth it, is of an ill life. It is our wiſdomes to looke what the gold is, and not what the bagge is that it came in, or what the man was that brought it. We are not to inquire ſo much what the life and converſation of the Miniſter is, as what his doctrine and admonitions are that hee teacheth; not what this <hi>Cato</hi> was, but what his precepts are; which in a word, are ſo wiſe, honeſt and good for every Chriſtian man and woman to reade and practice, that you ſhall not finde any Author, from whom
<pb facs="tcp:25221:5"/>
a civill life may gather better inſtructions. Many there are of my knowledge, which will not have their children brought up in learning, becauſe forſooth the Authors which they ſhould learne are heatheniſh, as this our <hi>Cato, Turrence, Mantuin, Ovid, Virgil, Homer,</hi> and the like: deſiring rather they ſhould live like idiots, and die like fooles, then to attaine knowledge (as they thinke) by ſuch unlawfull meanes. Others becauſe of the tenderneſſe, they beare to their children, will not have them brought up to learning too ſoone, thinking them even too yong to be taught, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their errour they affirme, if the child ſhould bee chaſtened it would make him both ſicke and fooliſh. But what is their end? they are ſoone too old to learne, and ſo become unprofitable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, infamous and diſobedient to their parents, ſo evill in conditions, ſo light and unadviſed in behavour, ſo unfit for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo inclined to lies, ſo envying the truth, that they are not onely a ſhame to their fathers which begot them, and a reproach to their mothers which bore
<pb facs="tcp:25221:6"/>
them, but a ſcandall and diſgrace to the ſucceeding generations after them. How ought you then to ſtudy and make uſe of your time, now whiles you may, leaſt you repent you hereafter, when it will be too late. The tree that bloſſome not in the ſpring, will hardly beare fruit in Autumne. If you labour no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for learning now in the ſummer and ſpring-time of your youth, you will hardly ever have any fruit thereof (as humility, love, obedience, and all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall bleſſings) in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and declining Autumne of your age. What although you be well deſcended, and your fathers eldeſt ſonne, and ſo the likelier to have the heavieſt purſe? the better and more nobler you are borne by birth, the better ought you to be inſtructed in your youth; and the more wealth you are like to have the more learning you ought to have put into you: for ſuch as leave great riches to their children, without ſeeing them brought up in literature (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith) are like unto them that give much provender to yong horſes, but never breake them at all, ſo that they waxe fat,
<pb facs="tcp:25221:6"/>
but unprofitable. The father (as one ſaith) is bound no more towards his childe, but to baniſh him from his pleaſures, and to give him vertuous maſters to inſtruct him. What the pleaſures are which fathers ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from their children, I know not; who let looſe the raines of liberty ſo upon them, that the child which moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they love beſt, (as the eldeſt) runne moſt at randome, unto all kindes of looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and licentiouſneſſe of life. Vertuous maſters I confeſſe, they many times have to teach them, but as the old ſaying is, as good nere the whit, as nere the better. For what are their children ere the better for them? they muſt not forſooth be taught abroad, for feare the winde ſhould blow on them; or from under their mothers winge, leaſt they ſhould ketch cold: but be taught at home in the preſence of their parents, that they may not ſtand in awe of their Tutour, and ſo learne too much. For ſo much audacity, is given to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are taught at home, and ſo little countenance ſhowne to the maſters which teach them, that one cannot well diſcerne,
<pb facs="tcp:25221:7"/>
who ſtands in moſt feare many times, the maſter or the ſcholler. That maſters muſt be thought either very indiſcreet, or too baſe and meane to give correction when they thinke fitting; or fathers very unwiſe to thinke that their children ſhould be too good to be corrected, when they deſerve it. Yet thus it is in great mens houſes, when children are negligent, and will not learne, maſters would correct rhem, but fathers and mothers forbid them, ſo that it little avayleth one to pricke the horſe with the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure, when he that ſitteth upon him holdeth backe with the bridle. And therefore let parents know although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be never ſo ignoble and meane, and children never ſo noble and well deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet muſt they ſtand in awe of them by whom they are taught, and have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at their hands, when occaſion ſerve, if ever they would have them to learne well; but with the fondneſſe of thoſe parents whoſe children are borne to higher fortunes, then others are, the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt brother many times is ſaine to ſuffer for the eldeſt brothers fault, or ſome other
<pb facs="tcp:25221:7"/>
meaner Gentlemans ſonne, that is trayned up with him to be his aſociate, inſomuch that an elder brother without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, now adaies, either of parents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or any one elſe, may doe any thing but that which is good, or be any thing but a wiſe man, which ſeldome troubles him. For although the eldeſt brother hath all the money and lands, yet the youngeſt moſt commonly gets all the wit and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and in time proves not onely the richeſt in eſtate, as I know ſome, but alſo in grace as there be many; whereas if they had met with the ſame ſauce in their childhood, that their yonger brothers have done, it would ſo whetted their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes, that they would have had as good an appetite to all goodneſſe, as their yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brothers. But as it is reported of the Ape that ſhe killeth her young ones, with overmuch hugging of them: ſo there be many ſuch like apiſh parents who ſpoyleth their children, with making too much of them, eſpecially if they have but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly childe to inherit their eſtate after them. For all the time they are at home, they

For too much liberty in youth is a manifeſt token of diſobedience in age. When they are put out to ſchoole though it be long firſt ere they goe, or be taught at home, the maſters hands are ſo faſt bound through a ſtrict command given them from the parents, not to touch them being taught at home: or large golden promiſes, not to correct them if they bee taught abroad, that the diſciples they teach many times periſh for want of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and impunity.

Therefore if any ſhould thinke, I have ſhowne but little wit, and leſſe manners in dealing thus plainely, or have any waies offended in delivering my minde thus freely, my apologie for my ſelfe ſhall be onely this: I would that my labours (being your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) ſhould be accounted rather honeſt than wiſe: For the wiſe can but pleaſe, but the honeſt can never diſpleaſe. But what ſhould I need to make any apology for that I have ſaid; when as I know ſome that are ſo golden, or rather earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if they can but heape up moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of wealth to leave their children, to make them rich; they care not how little mole-hils of learning they have to make them vertuous: forgetting that it is better to leave unto their children good doctrine whereby they may live, than evill riches whereby they may periſh: whoſe offence (as a wiſe Philoſopher ſaith) is
<pb facs="tcp:25221:9"/>
impardonable, that for heaping up of riches, forget to bring up their children in honeſt manners. If this be not true that I ſpeake, let experience ſpeake for me, who of her owne knowledge can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many lamentable examples of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens ſonnes, and great heires abroad in the world, who have had more wealth left them, than wit to uſe it, through want of this one principle of learning put into them, to ſeaſon and reliſh thoſe other parts and ornaments of nature they have beene endowed withall. Wherefore it ſtandeth parents in hand that have any true inward love toward the good of their children, to ſee them as well vertuouſly educated in learning as to provide for them great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>How much better is it to get wiſedome then gold? and to get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather to be choſen then ſilver?</hi> Let fathers and mothers then take it into their conſiderations, to uſe all the beſt meanes they can to put wiſedome and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into their childrens heads, as well as money into their purſes by training them up to learning, when they are young. <hi>A</hi>

                        <l>If I my fathers precepts had obey'd,</l>
                        <l>And by his counſell had beene rul'd and ſwaid,</l>

                        <l>Unto the gallowes, or execution place,</l>
                        <l>A traytor like unto my great diſgrace.</l>
                        <l>The ſecond was, that I ſhould nere prolong</l>

                        <l>Came of himſelfe, to hang me with all ſpeede:</l>
                        <l>And that was the reward from him that I</l>

                        <l>The third and laſt he left me in his life,</l>
                        <l>It was, that I ſhould prove, whether my wife</l>

                        <l>As you well know, to my diſhonour ſpoke;</l>
                        <l>For I have charg'd my ſelfe (the more's the pity)</l>
                        <l>With the great office of this famous city,</l>
                        <l>And alſo have ſet free at liberty</l>

                        <l>I then determined now in my life</l>
                        <l>To doe the third, which was to prove my wife,</l>
                        <l>If ſhe could keep my ſecrets firme and juſt</l>

                        <l>And ſo upon a night, with loving charmes</l>
                        <l>When I perceiv'd her waking, in my armes</l>
                        <l>I tooke her, and began to ſigh and mourne</l>
                        <l>And inwardly within my ſelfe to grone,</l>

                        <l>Then out of policie, in ſecret wiſe</l>

                        <l>(As ſhe me thought) I trembling to her ſaid</l>

                        <l>For I have ſlaine him in my raging luſt</l>

                        <l>Unto his parents, as I did intend.</l>
                        <l>At a rich banquet, for a preſent neate,</l>
                        <l>And they thereat their owne ſons heart had eate.</l>
                        <l>My wife this hearing, was exceeding ſad</l>
                        <l>And much lamented, as if that ſhe had</l>

                        <l>For naturally they're given to prate and talke</l>
                        <l>So that at randome oft their tongues doe walke,</l>
                        <l>Yet there be many ſober women eke,</l>

                  <p>THis foreſaid example giveth a good leſſon to all honeſt diſcreete and wiſe women, that they may keepe ſecret all things touching or apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the eſtate of their husbands, that they ſhew it to no creature living; for oftentimes it chanceth, that in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſmall matters, commeth much harme, and moſt times, when they thinke leaſt thereon. A cloſe mouth (as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) makes a wiſe head, and a fooliſh woman is eaſily knowne by her much ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. In being cloſe and ſecret, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch things as men would have kept cloſe and in ſecret, can come nothing but good and quietneſſe; for a word is like an arrow in a bow; when the arrow
<pb facs="tcp:25221:65"/>
is ſhot and gone from the bow, it maketh a noyſe, and cannot returne againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it taketh his lighting place: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a word, when it is ſpoken, and gone out of the mouth, it cannot come againe before it be diſperſt unto the auditors and ſtanders by, aud of them is heard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, either in the good or evill part; therefore it is good to have in memory, and marke well the ſaying of the wiſeman <hi>Salomon;</hi> firſt thinke a thing twiſe or thrice before thou ſpeake it, and take good heed and regard to what end and effect it may turne and come unto before thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneſt thy mouth for where much babling is, there muſt needes be offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe that refraineth and bridleth her tongue, is wiſe; an innocent tongue is a noble trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and as one wiſely ſaith; ſilence in a woman is a ſpeciall vertue. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee a dumbe Graſhopper, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:25221:65"/>
the whole kinde of them is garrulous: yet more wonderfull it is to ſee conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſilence in women, becauſe their Sex is mutable and loquacious, the toung is an unruly member, eſpecially in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans mouth; but where grace is, it is eaſily bridled: the tongue is called the gate of life and death, and that in this reſpect, for by it the lives of our ſelves and others are daily hazarded, as you may ſee in the ſtory immediatly going before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would once againe adviſe all wiſe and diſcreet women, or that would ſo bee thought and accounted, when their tongues at any time ſhall be moſt active, and nimble for diſcourſe, to thinke upon <hi>Catos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> wife, that they reveale not in any wiſe, any ſecret, whereby any miſchiefe may come thereof: for by a word ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and that to her neare friend, and to one of her owne Sex, which one would
<pb facs="tcp:25221:66"/>
have thought would have kept her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, into what great perill had ſhee like to have brought her husband and her ſelfe. Labour then to amend your own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in this one thing, otherwiſe the danger and ſhame in the end will light upon your ſelves, as the verſe herefol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing doth ſhew:
<q>
                        <l>Women whoſe tongues before their wit doth run,</l>
                        <l>Oft ſpeaks too ſoone, &amp; rues when they have done.</l>
                     </q>
But this is not written onely to be marked of women, but alſo of all perſons, of what eſtate and degree ſoever they bee, that have any matter of ſecret or counſell committed unto them, that they may hereby learne and beware how they ſhew or declare any thing that they ſhall heare, ſee done, or ſaid in any counſell, for many times, by uttering of a ſmall thing, great inconvenience doth come, and much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to things pretended.</p>
